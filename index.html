    <h1>LOCAL LABORATORY DISCOVERS NEW ELEMENT!</h1>
    <p> After many years of intense scientific study, local science power-house Sinister Solutions has discovered a previously unknown super-rare element, which they have dubbed Dubnine! </p>

    <p>   In an exclusive interview with one of the lead physicists that discovered the element, Dr. Mi Sing Xu, we learned some fascinating details about the discovery. "I have only myself and my brain to thank for this incredible discovery, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise!", Xu touted, pictured below.  </p>
          
    <p>      "I am certain that my discovery of Dubnine, named for my hometown <b>Dubna</b>, will have incredible scientific repercussions. What those repercussions are, I cannot say at this moment.. NO MORE QUESTIONS!"  </p>
          
     <p>  Dr. Xu assured us that he would (single-handedly) discover the new element's potential before storming off while muttering to himself. Fascinating stuff! For more tech and science news, be sure to subscribe to our science newsletter, "Why if?"! </p>
