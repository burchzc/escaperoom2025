    <h1>Transcript</h1>
    <p>Is this...is this blasted thing on? Agh....ah, there we go. *ahem* This is Dr. Cornelius Yi. I've been working at Sinister Solutions for about....twenty-two years now.
        I have reason to believe that my counter-part, Dr. Mi Sing Xu, is on to something big. World-changing, even. 
      But he's keeping it close to the chest - won't let any of the other physicists near it. I have a theory that it's some kind of...miracle substance. 
      A new element with extra-ordinary healing potential! We've developed something similar in the past, but we've yet to find a way to give it a half-life longer than a few milliseconds... 
      If my theory is correct, however, Dr. Xu has found it. And knowing him, and this company, they'll sell it to the highest bidder. The world would never know of this incredible work of science! <p>
 
     <p> That's where you come in. I've hired you, the cyber red-team, to er....infiltrate the laboratory. I've left clues around Xu and I's workspace, clues that will help you get to the element. I'd get it myself, but I fear that they're on to me... </p>
 
     <p><i></i>*a distant crashing noise* </i></p>
 
     <p> What was that?! .... I must go, I can't have you compromised as well. Follow the clues! Use your cyber skills to find that element, and fast! Yi will be back any minute... Look for my rubber ducky! </p>
 
     <p><i>*feed fuzzes out*</i></p>
